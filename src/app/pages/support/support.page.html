      <p>
        Our goal is to assist users in tracking their loan EMIs and to encourage
        prepayments by demonstrating potential savings. By providing insights
        into how small prepayments or part payments can significantly reduce the
        overall interest and shorten the loan tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people find it challenging to understand the logic behind EMI
        calculations. Our aim is to simplify this process and help users
        comprehend how their monthly EMIs are determined. We will provide clear
        explanations of how each EMI contributes to reducing the principal loan
        amount and how interest is calculated. By breaking down these details.
