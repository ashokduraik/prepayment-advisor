<p>Our aim is to help you to track of your loan EMI and encourage you to pay prepayment by showing the laon interest reduction and term reduction due to prepayment or part payment.</p>
<p>Most people feels difficult to understand the logic behind the EMI calculation. We are trying to help people to understand, How EMI is calculated each month and how each month of your loan principle amount is reduced.</p>
