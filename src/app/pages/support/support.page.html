      <p>
        Our aim is to help you to track of your loan EMI and encourage you to pay prepayment by showing the laon
        interest
        reduction and term reduction due to prepayment or part payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people feels difficult to understand the logic behind the EMI calculation. We are trying to help people to
        understand, How EMI is calculated each month and how each month of your loan principle amount is reduced.

        We personally felt difficult when we planned to pay prepayment because we don't how much it could reduce the
        loan
        interest amount and tenure, so our aim to help the people like us.
